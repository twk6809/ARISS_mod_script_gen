ARISS Moderator Script Generator - Template Catalog
===================================================

Ver 3.1.0   


The moderator script generator tool comes with a set of template script 
files. These will produce fully functional scripts that cover most 
ARISS contact needs. There are two basic versions; long and short. The 
difference is the inclusion of the two optional ARISS videos, or not. 
At the bottom of the template cover page is version information 
indicating the original source template file name, release date, and 
author.

To efficiently use this catalog, it is best to first determine if the 
two optional videos will be presented or not. Based on that, the 
recommendation is to choose either the LONG or SHORT version template. 

Note that this catalog, and/or the templates, might be updated 
independently from any updates to the script tool (Python program). 
If you need/want a different template, contact this author.


TEMPLATES
---------

ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_long.docx - Ver. 2025-05-20, by N3FZX

	This is based on the universal template and includes both of the 
	optional videos. This template is streamlined with some redline 
	notes removed for the video events. If using this template, be 
	sure the form file indicates "Yes" for both videos.

ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_short.docx - Ver. 2025-05-20, by N3FZX

	This is based on the universal template without either of the 
	optional videos. This matches a traditional ARISS contact script.
	The timeline outline reflects the lack of videos. If using this 
	template, be sure the form file indicates "No" for both videos.

ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_universal.docx - Ver. 2025-05-20, by N3FZX

	All the templates included here are derived from this one. This 
	includes both optional videos. The video events have some redline
	notes to help the author. This can be tailored for any combination 
	of optional videos. The form file video usage must be set to match.

ARISS_mod_script_temp.docx

	Copy of the universal script, but with the default file name that 
	the	script expects as an input file.
