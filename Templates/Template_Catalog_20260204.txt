ARISS Moderator Script Generator - Template Catalog
===================================================

Ver 4.0.0   


The moderator script generator tool comes with a set of template script 
files. These will produce fully functional scripts that cover most 
ARISS contact needs. The wording is generic enough for both school and 
non-school based events. Moderators are encouraged to edit the 
`ARISS_mod_script_temp.docx` file for their event. Just be aware of the
amount of change can alter the timing from defaults. Be sure to check 
the timing and update the form file as needed.

The provided `docx` templates have a version date on the bottom of the 
cover page. Compare this to the versions posted in **GitHub** to be sure 
you are using the latest templates.

There are two basic versions; long and short. 

The difference is the inclusion of the two optional ARISS videos, or not. 
At the bottom of the template cover page is version information 
indicating the original source template file name, release date, and 
author.

To efficiently use this catalog, it is best to first determine if the 
two optional videos will be presented or not. Based on that, choose the 
template. Be sure to edit the form file to correctly indicate which video 
is being used. 

Note that this catalog, and/or the templates, might be updated 
independently from any updates to the script tool (Python program). 
If you need/want a different template, contact this author.

---------

ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_long.docx - Ver. 2026-02-04, by N3FZX

	This is based on the universal template and includes both of the 
	optional videos. This template is streamlined with some redline 
	notes removed for the video events. If using this template, be 
	sure the form file indicates "Yes" for both videos.


ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_short.docx - Ver. 2026-02-04, by N3FZX

	This is based on the universal template without either of the 
	optional videos. This closely matches a traditional ARISS contact 
	script. If using this template, be sure the form file indicates 
	"No" for both videos. Note that Events #8 and #9 are not used and 
	should have a zero time duration.


ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_translation.docx - Ver. 2026-02-04, by N3FZX

	This is a new experimental one based on the universal template, but 
	with provisions for including language translations. This includes 
	both optional videos. The video events have some redline notes to help 
	the author. This can be tailored for any combination of optional 
	videos. The form file video usage must be set to match.


ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_universal.docx - Ver. 2026-02-04, by N3FZX

	All the templates included here are derived from this one. This 
	includes both optional videos. The video events have some redline
	notes to help the author. This can be tailored for any combination

	duration.
