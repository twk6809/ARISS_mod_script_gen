ARISS Moderator Script Generator - Template Catalog
===================================================

The moderator script generator tool comes with a set of template script 
files. These will produce fully functional scripts that cover most 
ARISS contact needs. The wording is generic enough for both school and 
non-school based events. Moderators are encouraged to edit the 
ARISS_mod_script_temp.docx file for their event. Just be aware of the
amount of change can alter the timing from defaults. Be sure to check 
the timing and update the form file as needed.

There are two basic versions; long and short. 
The difference is the inclusion of the two optional ARISS videos, or not. 
At the bottom of the template cover page is version information 
indicating the original source template file name, release date, and 
author.

To efficiently use this catalog, it is best to first determine if the 
two optional videos will be presented or not. Based on that, the 
recommendation is to choose either the LONG or SHORT version template. 

If only one video is planned start with the LONG version and remove the 
event block for the video not used. Be sure to edit the form file to 
correctly indicate which video is being used. If a video different than 
what is normal used is planned, be sure to adjust the for file for the 
duration of that event block.

Note that this catalog, and/or the templates, might be updated 
independently from any updates to the script tool (Python program). 
If you need/want a different template, contact this author.


TEMPLATES
---------

ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_long.docx - Ver. 2025-09-07, by N3FZX

	This is based on the universal template and includes both of the 
	optional videos. This template is streamlined with some redline 
	notes removed for the video events. If using this template, be 
	sure the form file indicates "Yes" for both videos.

ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_short.docx - Ver. 2025-09-07, by N3FZX

	This is based on the universal template without either of the 
	optional videos. This closely matches a traditional ARISS contact 
	script. The timeline outline reflects the lack of videos. If using 
	this template, be sure the form file indicates "No" for both videos.

ARISS_mod_script_temp_master_universal.docx - Ver. 2025-09-07, by N3FZX

	All the templates included here are derived from this one. This 
	includes both optional videos. The video events have some redline
	notes to help the author. This can be tailored for any combination 
	of optional videos. The form file video usage must be set to match.

ARISS_mod_script_temp.docx

	Copy of the universal script, but with the default file name that 
	the	script expects as an input file.
