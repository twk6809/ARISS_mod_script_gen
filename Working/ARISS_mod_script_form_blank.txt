#
# This form is used to generate an ARISS moderator script.
# The Python script ARISS_mod_script_gen.py will read this
# form and combine with a script template to create a
# complete moderator script in a properly formatted MS-WORD
# document and a timeline report.
#
# The script timeline is calculated based on estimated durations
# of the event blocks defined in the Timeline Assumptions section.
#
# THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS FORM:
#
#   Lines that begin with a "#" are comments.
#     Feel free to add more comments to make notes.
#   The form consists of a list of field names and variables.

#   Be sure to update the version number if doing a revision.
#   Do NOT change the field names.
