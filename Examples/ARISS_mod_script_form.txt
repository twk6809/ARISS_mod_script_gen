#
# This form is used to generate an ARISS moderator script.
# The Python script ARISS_mod_script_gen.py will read this
# form and combine with a script template to create a
# complete moderator script in a properly formatted MS-WORD
# document and a timeline report.
#
# The script timeline is calculated based on estimated durations
# of the event blocks.
#
# THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS FORM:
#
#   Lines that begin with a "#" are comments.
#   Feel free to add more comments to make notes.
#   The form consists of a list of field names and variables.
#     Field name: {{variable}}
#     School/group name: {{school_group_name}}
#   Field names must be separated from variables with a colon+space
#     ": "
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
#   Replace the variables, including {{ and }}, with known data.
#   For example:
#     School/group name: {{school_group_name}}
#     School/group name: My school
#   Be sure to update the version number if doing a revision.
#   Do NOT change the field names.
#   Do NOT add or remove lines, except for comments.
#   Do NOT use line breaks, carriage returns or hard word wrap
#     for any long lines.
#   Adjust timeline event block durations only as needed.
